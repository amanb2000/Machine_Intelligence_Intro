    "_Question: IF the two files you compared above are the same, does it prove that your code is correct? Explain._\n",
    "\n",
    "_Answer:_ Strong similarity give a good hint that the code is *probably* correct, but it by no means proves it. I may, for instance, have made a mistake in the way was assigning values during my computation resulting in the copying of a an incorrect result to both files. As well, the files are saved differently (CSV vs. npy) -- depending on what 'comparison' and 'the same' mean, I may arrive at an incorrect conclusion. If I were to examine the contents of the files in an intelligent fashion and take into account the fact that the floating point arithmetic may result in slightly different results, then I could get a decent sense of the correctness. At no point, however, would I be able to 'prove' the correctness of my code through any observation of the output."
